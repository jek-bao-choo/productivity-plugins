# Datadog RFP/RFI Response Template

This is the output format reference. Follow the column definitions, category taxonomy, supportability values, and example table below when generating the RFP/RFI response.

---

## Column Definitions

| Column | Purpose | Guidance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Category / Section / Area / Dimension / Domain** | Groups the requirement into a logical domain | Use values from the Category Taxonomy below. If a requirement spans multiple categories, pick the primary one. |
| **Prospect's Requirement / Inquiry / Question / Description / Framework** | The extracted requirement, quoted from the raw notes | Quote directly using `"..."` when possible. For technical stack items, include language, version, and framework. For infrastructure, include platform, version, and orchestrator details. If the notes are vague, extract what exists and flag specifics for clarification. |
| **Datadog's Supportability** | How well Datadog supports this requirement | Allowed values: `Yes`, `Partial`, `Comply`, `Clarification`. See Supportability Values section below. |
| **Datadog's Response / Remark / Comment** | Datadog's detailed response to the requirement | Must be sourced via the tiered search escalation defined in SKILL.md: Datadog docs/blog/trust/legal → Datadog GitHub → internal KB → OpenTelemetry. Explain how Datadog addresses the requirement. If the answer comes from OpenTelemetry, clearly state that native Datadog support is not available and describe the OTel-based approach. Never fabricate capabilities. |
| **Datadog's Doc / Blog / Trust / Legal URL** | Supporting URL from the source that confirmed supportability | Must be a real URL found via web search. May come from `datadoghq.com` (docs, blog, trust, legal), `github.com/DataDog/`, Datadog internal KB, or `opentelemetry.io` / `github.com/open-telemetry/` depending on which tier yielded the answer. Write `NA` if no relevant URL is found. Never fabricate URLs. |
| **Datadog's Demo URLs** | Link to relevant Datadog demo environment page | Must start with `https://demo.datadoghq.com/`. Use https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp to discover relevant demo pages. Write `NA` if no relevant demo page exists. |

| **Data Storage Location** | Data residency, on-premise requirements, cloud regions, data sovereignty | "Data must stay in EU", "On-premise storage preferred" |
| **Security & Compliance** | Security certifications, compliance frameworks, audit requirements, encryption | "Need SOC 2 Type II compliance" |
| **Lawfulness** | Legal, regulatory, AI ethics, data processing laws | "Does the AI have potential to violate laws?" |
| **Data Protection Laws & Regulations** | Specific data protection regulations, DPAs, privacy frameworks | "Need a Data Processing Addendum" |
| **Platform & Architecture Support** | Backup, disaster recovery, high availability, specific architecture patterns | "Backup integration with Cohesity DataProtect" |
| **Performance & Scalability** | Performance requirements, SLAs, throughput, latency targets | "Must handle 10M events per second" |
| **User Management & Access Control** | SSO, RBAC, multi-tenancy, identity providers | "Need SAML SSO with Okta" |
| **Cost & Licensing** | Pricing model, licensing terms, cost optimization | "Need per-host pricing model" |
| **Other** | Requirements that do not fit the above categories | Note in the response column suggesting a more specific category |

## Supportability Values

Each requirement must be assigned exactly one of these four values:

- **Yes** — Datadog fully supports this requirement out of the box or with standard configuration. Use when Datadog documentation or blog posts confirm full support.
- **Partial** — Datadog addresses this requirement but with limitations, workarounds, or only partial coverage. Always explain what is supported and what is not in the response column.
- **Comply** — The requirement is a compliance, legal, or policy question and Datadog meets the standard. Use for regulatory, certification, or legal questions.
- **Clarification** — The requirement is ambiguous, incomplete, or requires a deeper conversation with the prospect to understand what they actually need. Always write a specific clarification question in the response column.

**Decision tree:**

1. Is it a compliance/legal/policy question and Datadog meets it? → **Comply**
2. Is the requirement clear and Datadog fully supports it? → **Yes**
3. Is the requirement clear but Datadog only partially supports it? → **Partial**
4. Is the requirement unclear, ambiguous, or missing critical detail? → **Clarification**

| Category / Section / Area / Dimension / Domain | Prospect's Requirement / Inquiry / Question / Description / Framework | Datadog's Supportability | Datadog's Response / Remark / Comment | Datadog's Doc / Blog / Trust / Legal URL | Datadog's Demo URLs |

| Observability | End-to-end visibility across applications, infrastructure, and services. | Yes | End-to-end application monitoring in Datadog eliminates visibility gaps and unifies insights across your frontend and backend monitoring. Datadog's trace view gives you detailed request data and correlated information in a single pane of glass. In addition to the flame graph—which shows you the full path of each request—the trace view displays the corresponding metrics, logs, and other data you need to understand the context of the request so you can efficiently investigate performance problems like errors and latency. End-to-end visibility means having a unified view of applications, infrastructure, and services so you can: Trace requests across the entire stack. Correlate metrics, logs, and traces in one place. Quickly identify performance issues, dependencies, and root causes. It's about seeing everything from code to infrastructure to user impact in one continuous picture. | [https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/end-to-end-application-monitoring/](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/end-to-end-application-monitoring/) | [https://demo.datadoghq.com/software?env=prod\&fromUser=true\&graphType=waterfall\&shouldShowLegend=true\&traceQuery=\&view=map](https://demo.datadoghq.com/software?env=prod&fromUser=true&graphType=waterfall&shouldShowLegend=true&traceQuery=&view=map) |
| Integration & Extensibility | CI/CD pipeline integration and DevOps toolchain compatibility. | Yes | Datadog integrates with a wide range of CI/CD and DevOps tools, including Jenkins, GitLab, and CircleCI.

| Platform & Architecture Support | Backup and disaster recovery integration with Cohesity DataProtect, Helios, and SmartFiles. | Clarification | Further discussion is recommended to align on the specific outcome. | NA | NA |
| Data Storage Location | Preference for data to be stored on-premise | Partial | Logs can be stored on-premise or a customer's own cloud environment (Bring Your Own Cloud). Metrics and traces are sanitized before being stored in Datadog's backend systems, which adhere to rigorous compliance and trust standards such as SOC 2 and others. These data centers are located across the US, Europe, Japan, and Australia. Additionally, PrivateLink and VPC Peering can be established to ensure secure and reliable connectivity. | [https://docs.datadoghq.com/cloudprem/](https://docs.datadoghq.com/cloudprem/) | [https://demo.datadoghq.com/cloudprem](https://demo.datadoghq.com/cloudprem) |
| Lawfulness | Does the Datadog AI have any potential to violate laws and regulations? | Comply | Datadog is committed to lawful and ethical operations. We provide a platform that helps customers meet their own compliance obligations. Our platform itself undergoes rigorous, independent third-party audits and certifications (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI DSS), demonstrating our adherence to global security and privacy standards. | [https://trust.datadoghq.com/](https://trust.datadoghq.com/) | NA |

> **Reminder — Critical Instructions:**
> - If a requirement is mentioned in the input, quote it directly using `"..."`
> - Do NOT hallucinate, assume, or infer anything that was not explicitly mentioned
> - If a requirement is not covered in the input, do not guess — flag it for clarification with the customer or prospect
> - Each distinct requirement, technology, or question gets its own row
> - All responses must be grounded in web search results — never fabricate capabilities or URLs
> - When in doubt about supportability, use "Clarification" rather than guessing "Yes" or "Partial"
> - Gaps and "Clarification" entries are valuable — they tell the sales team exactly what to discuss next
